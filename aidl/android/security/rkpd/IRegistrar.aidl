     * remotely provisioned keys should be managed.
     *
     * Notes:
     * - This function will attempt to get the service named by irpcName. This
     *   implies that a lazy/dynamic aidl service will be instantiated, and this
     *   function blocks until the service is up. Upon return, any binder tokens
     *   are dropped, allowing the lazy/dynamic service to shutdown.
     * - The returned registration object is unique per caller. If two different
     *   UIDs call getRegistration with the same irpcName, they will receive
     *   different registrations back. This prevents two different applications
     *   from being able to see the same keys.
     * - This function is idempotent per calling UID. Additional calls to
     *   getRegistration with the same parameters, from the same caller, will have
     *   no side effects.
     *
     * Errors:
     * - If irpcName does not reference an IRemotelyProvisionedComponent that can
     *   be fetched from IServiceManager, this function fails with
     *   STATUS_BAD_VALUE.
